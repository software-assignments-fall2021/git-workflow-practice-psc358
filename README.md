# Learning lessons from Pixar as a Software Developer
### I recently read [this article](https://review.firstround.com/Lessons-from-Pixar-Why-Software-Developers-should-be-Story-Tellers) explaining the importance and the benefits of story telling in software development.

A software development team at Pixar realized that designing software really resembles creating a great story, like Pixar often does. This led to the development of a story department within the software team. The team found artists that were between movies to help them create story boards to design the user workflows, as well as help to help them comment on and improve their software - since they are the ultimate users of the software. There was now someone who was testing out improvements and giving constant feedback to help developers find ways to better the software. The team was also inspired by the latest film "reels" that are presented to the entire company a couple times of years, and created their own "reels" which were short hand drawn animated movies that displayed how users interact with the improved or new software. Similar to the film "reels", this was presented to the entire company every 6 months, allowing for feedback from anyone in the company more often. This artistic approach to software development allowed devs to get new perspectives and just have more fun during the process of creating exciting software.
